**A Business Intelligence analysis using long-term weather data to quantify how solar and wind farm performance varies with meteorological conditions in South Africa.**

## The Challenge
Renewable energy output is highly variable. Grid operators and investors need reliable forecasts and insights to manage risk, plan investments, and ensure grid stability.

## Key Insights
- **Technology Choice is Climate-Dependent:** Higher temperatures **boost CSP output** but **reduce PV efficiency**.
- **Forecast Accuracy has a Critical Gap:** Prediction errors spike at **midday**—precisely when solar generation is highest and the grid is most vulnerable.
- **Portfolio Diversification is Essential:** Solar is strong in summer but weak in winter. Wind is a volatile but crucial year-round backbone. A mix of both provides the most stable supply.
